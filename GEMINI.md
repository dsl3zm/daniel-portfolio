# Daniel Portfolio Project Context

## Project Overview
**Daniel Portfolio** is a personal portfolio website built with **Angular** (v19+). It is a Single Page Application (SPA) designed to be hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

The application currently features a straightforward architecture:
*   **Main Component:** `AppComponent` acts as the root shell.
*   **Feature Component:** `HomePageComponent` contains the primary content, leveraging **Angular Material** for UI components (Cards, Dividers, Icons).
*   **Routing:** Currently unused (`app.routes.ts` is empty), as the app directly embeds the home page component.

## Key Technologies
*   **Framework:** Angular (Standalone Components)
*   **UI Library:** Angular Material
*   **Styling:** SCSS
*   **Build Tool:** Angular CLI (using `@angular/build:application`)

## Building and Running

### Development Server
To start the local development server:
```bash
ng serve
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will reload automatically on source changes.

### Build for Production
To build the project for deployment:
```bash
ng build
```
**Important:**
*   The build output is configured to the `docs/` directory (instead of `dist/`).
*   This specific configuration is set in `angular.json` to support **GitHub Pages** deployment from the main branch's `docs` folder.
*   The `baseHref` is set to `/daniel-portfolio/browser/`.

### Testing
To run unit tests:
```bash
ng test
```

## Development Conventions

*   **Standalone Components:** The project uses Angular's standalone component API (no `NgModule` boilerplate).
*   **Asset Management:** Static assets (images, icons) are located in the `public/` directory and copied to the build output.
*   **Formatting:** Follows standard Angular CLI structure and conventions.
*   **Route Prerendering:** `angular.json` configuration supports prerendering, though currently only the root route is active.

## Directory Structure Highlights
*   `src/app/` - Contains the source code for the application logic and components.
*   `src/app/home-page/` - The main content feature component.
*   `public/` - Static assets like images and favicons.
*   `docs/` - The distribution target for GitHub Pages (generated by `ng build`).
